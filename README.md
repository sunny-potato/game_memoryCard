# game_memoryCard

Memory card game using HTML, CSS, JS

What I have tried here.

1. HTML DOM
   Create elements(div, img) by JS to HTML
   understand Element.classList.add/remove/toggle()

Problems occured

1. Race condition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition)
   when cards are clicked sequentially, matching and non-matching didn't work well.
2. simple codes
   -> using array make the codes simple
